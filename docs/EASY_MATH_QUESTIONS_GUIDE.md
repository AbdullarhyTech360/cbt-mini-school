## Tips for Success

### ✅ DO:
1. **Use Alt + = for all math** - Opens Equation Editor
2. **Press Esc when done** - Exits Equation Editor
3. **Test with 2-3 questions first** - Make sure it works
4. **Save as .docx** - Not .doc
5. **Mark correct answer with *** - Very important!

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Don't type math symbols directly** - Use Equation Editor
2. **Don't use images of equations** - Use Equation Editor instead
3. **Don't forget to press Esc** - Finish the equation first
4. **Don't mix formats** - Be consistent

## Troubleshooting

### "My equation looks weird"
- Make sure you pressed `Esc` after typing the equation
- Try typing it again in Equation Editor

### "Symbols don't show up"
- Use Equation Editor (`Alt + =`), don't type symbols directly
- Type the LaTeX command (like `\sqrt`) and press Space

### "Upload fails"
- Save as .docx (not .doc)
- Make sure all questions have Type and Options
- Check that correct answers are marked with *
